<h1>Why I Think Summer is The Worst Season</h1>
<p>There are 4 seasons on Earth. These seasons are Winter, Fall, Spring, and Summer. Many people have reasons to think that their favorite season is the best. This is a pretty normal thing to have, <a href="https://github.com/Aiden-Thompson/TEALS/wiki/winter%231">I even have my own</a>. I do know that one season should be NO ONE'S favorite, Summer.</p>

<h2>The Inescapable Heat</h2>
<p>This is easily the worst part about Summer. I do not see how anyone can like Summer with the heat. It's like playing hide and seek in an open field.</p><h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Big_field._-_geograph.org.uk_-_141390.jpg" alt="Big field" width="500" height="300"></h2>
<p>It can easily find you, and it is impossible for you to hide. You can't go to a pool. Public ones are not an option because the Corona Virus is still around and private ones are not because you will have to buy a private pool. Fans and air conditioners will help but not really deal with it. Cold drinks are a short-term relief. There is no escape.</p>
<h2>Summer Break</h2>
<p> Summer Break is nice. A nice 2 month long break from school is good. I only have one problem with it. The problem is that it occurs in Summer. A break should be spent relaxing and just having fun. It is quite hard to have fun in the insane heat. Summer Break could be much better, if it would just be in any other season. I would especially love it if it were in Winter instead. I would be able to properly enjoy it better.</p>

<h2>Summary/Conclusion</h2>
<p>I heavily dislike Summer because of the insane heat and how it makes it hard to enjoy myself. I personally do not see my opinion about Summer changing at all in the foreseeable future, but you never really know.</p>
